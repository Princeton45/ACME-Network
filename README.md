# ACME-Network

This network is basically used to replicate and test common IT infrastructure that is used in corportate companies. Included in my replication are 2 Domain Controllers for redundancy which include DHCP & DNS, a File server, a Mail server, a VPN server , and a Windows 10 Pro client machine. 

Now, an IT infrastructure consists of more than just what I mentioned. My goal was to just hammer down on the main components and the components in which I could be utilizing in a helpdesk/system administrator position.
