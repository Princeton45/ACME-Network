# ACME-Network

This network is basically used to replicate and test common IT infrastructure that is used in corportate companies. Included in my replication are 2 Domain Controllers for redundancy which include DHCP & DNS, a File/Print server, a Mail server, a VPN server , and a Windows 10 Pro client machine. The ACME Network is all under an Active Directory Domain (called int.acme.com) with multiple group policies.

Now, an IT infrastructure consists of more than just what I mentioned. My goal was to just hammer down on the main components and the components in which I could be utilizing in a helpdesk/system administrator position. 

This repository will be used for me to document the network and briefly explain how I set each component up.
